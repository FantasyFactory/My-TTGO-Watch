# My-TTGO-Watch-MyBasic

Software per lo smartwatch T-WATCH 2020 di LILIGO, basato sull'ottimo lavoro di Dirk Broßwick [sharandac](https://github.com/sharandac) che potete trovare qui https://github.com/sharandac/My-TTGO-Watch

Questo fork si differisce per l'implementazione di un interprete BASIC, basato sul progetto https://github.com/paladin-t/my_basic
e sul suo porting esp32 https://github.com/EternityForest/mybasic_esp32

L'idea alla base di questo fork è avere delle "app" scritte in BASIC, che implementino tutte le funzionalità dell'orologio (sveglia, contapassi ecc) e le caratteristiche dell'hardware (touchscreen, accelerometro, connessione internet, filesystem ecc) come funzioni speciali BASIC, in modo da rendere semplice lo sviluppo di "app" che possano girare in un ambiente protetto, senza la necessità e la difficoltà di essere integrate in un software monolitico.

Il passo successivo sarà creare una sorta di "app store", in modo che le applicazioni BASIC possano essere condivise e scaricate direttamente sull'orologio.

Software for LILIGO's T-WATCH 2020 smartwatch, based on the excellent work of Dirk Browick [sharandac](https://github.com/sharandac) that you can find here https://github.com/sharandac/My-TTGO-Watch

This fork differs in the implementation of a BASIC interpreter, based on the project https://github.com/paladin-t/my_basic
and it's esp32 porting https://github.com/EternityForest/mybasic_esp32

The idea behind this fork is to have "apps" written in BASIC, which implement all the features of the watch (alarm clock, pedometer etc.) and the features of the hardware (touchscreen, accelerometer, internet connection, filesystem etc.) as special BASIC functions, so as to make it easy to develop "apps" that can run in a protected environment, without the need and difficulty of being integrated into monolithic software.

The next step will be to create a kind of "app store" so that BASIC apps can be shared and downloaded directly to your watch.

# Install

Clone this repository and open it with platformIO. Build and upload. On a terminal in vscode you can do it with

```bash
pio run -t upload
```

or simple press "build and upload" in platformIO.

# known issues

* the webserver crashes the ESP32 really often
* the battery indicator is not accurate, rather a problem with the power management unit ( axp202 )
* from time to time the esp32 crashes accidentally
* and some other small things

# how to use

## weather app

On startup you see the main screen (time tile). It show the time and the current weather (if correct configure). Now you can swipe with you fingers up, down, left and right between the four main screens. The four screens are organized in time, apps, note and setup tile.
For the weather app you need an openweather.com api-id. http://openweathermap.org/appid is a good starting point.

## bluetooth

The bluetooth notification work with [gadgetbridge](https://gadgetbridge.org) very well. But keep in mind, bluetooth in standby reduces the battery runtime. In connection with [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net) the watch can also be used for navigation. Please use the osmand app, otherwise a lot of messages will be displayed.

# for the programmers

Internal RAM is very limited, use PSRAM as much as possible. When you work with ArduinoJson, include this

```#include "hardware/json_psram_allocator.h"```

and create your json with

```SpiRamJsonDocument doc( 1000 );```

to move your json into PSRAM, here is enough RAM for all the crazy stuff you will do. And use

```ps_malloc(), ps_calloc() and ps_realloc()```

as often as possible.
And one very important thing: Do not talk directly to the hardware!

## Sound
To play sounds from the inbuild speakers use `hardware/sound.h`:

```
#include "hardware/sound.h"
[...]
// MP3 from SPIFFS:
// void sound_play_spiffs_mp3( const char *filename );
// example:
sound_play_spiffs_mp3( "/sound.mp3" )

// or WAV from PROGMEM via
//void sound_play_progmem_wav( const void *data, uint32_t len );

```

There is a configuration tile to enable/disable all sound output and set the global volume.

# how to make a screenshot
The firmware has an integrated webserver. Over this a screenshot can be triggered. The image has the format RGB565 and can be read with gimp. From bash it look like this
```bash
wget x.x.x.x/shot ; wget x.x.x.x/screen.565
```
